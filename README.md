Difficulty Setting

The difficulty setting can be any of these options:

Easy

Easy is a game mode where the program does not think ahead. This mode is reccomended for begginer players and players looking for an easy win after being thrashed by the computer in normal mode.

Normal

Normal is a game mode where the program uses everything it has at it's disposal to try to emerge victorious. (Everything I have programmed it to do)
This mode is reccomended for players looking for an 'intelligent' opponent. Begginer players may also want to try out this mode to see a decent example of a chess player.

By default, the settings are as follows:
